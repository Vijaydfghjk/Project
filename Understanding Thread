What is Thread?

Threads are sequences of instructions given to the CPU.

1. Thread will define based on the core.

2. for example i core 7 means it has be 8 logical cores.
 so we have 8 threads. which means 8 tasks we use at the same  example 
 one is browsing, streaming, file uploading like that.

3.one thread can handle the multiple tasks which can switching the task concurrently.

4.threads are executed by cores, and having more cores (or SMT support) enables true multithreading for concurrent execution of tasks. 

5.Multithread ?

Multi-Core Systems: In a system with multiple CPU cores, the OS can allocate different threads to different cores. 
This allows multiple threads to execute truly simultaneously, improving overall performance.

6.On a single-core processor, achieving true multithreading where multiple threads can execute concurrently requires support for Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) or a similar technology.

7. Single Core ?

Single-Core Systems: On a single-core CPU, the OS can only execute one thread at a time. It uses techniques like time slicing to rapidly switch between threads, 
creating the illusion of simultaneous execution.
