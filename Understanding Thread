What is Thread?

Threads are sequences of instructions given to the CPU.

Thread will define based on the core.

for example i core 7 means it has be 8 logical cores.
so we have 8 threads. which means 8 tasks we use at the same  example 
one is browsing, streaming, file uploading like that.

one thread can handle the multiple tasks which can switching the task concurrently.


Multithread ?

If your processor has multiple cores (for example, dual-core, quad-core, etc.), each core can handle its own thread independently.
This means that if you have a dual-core processor, it can handle at least two threads concurrently. 
if i have more than one core so i can achieve the multithread right 
if i have  only one thread to achieving multithread not possible right
