What is Thread?

Threads are sequences of instructions given to the CPU.

1. Thread will define based on the core.

2. for example i core 7 means it has be 8 logical cores.
 so we have 8 threads. which means 8 tasks we use at the same  example 
 one is browsing, streaming, file uploading like that.

3.one thread can handle the multiple tasks which can switching the task concurrently.

4.threads are executed by cores, and having more cores (or SMT support) enables true multithreading for concurrent execution of tasks. 

5.Multithread ?

If your processor has multiple cores (for example, dual-core, quad-core, etc.), each core can handle its own thread independently.
This means that if you have a dual-core processor, it can handle at least two threads concurrently. 
if i have more than one core so i can achieve the multithread right 
if i have  only one thread to achieving multithread not possible right

6.On a single-core processor, achieving true multithreading where multiple threads can execute concurrently requires support for Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT) or a similar technology.
